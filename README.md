1. The time complexity for the search and insert functions would be the value of log base 2 of 10000 = 13.288. The number 10000 comes from the number inputs to the Red-Black tree. The best-case scenario would be the time complexity equaling the value of log base 3 of 10000 = 8.383. Since this is a large data set the time complexity is most likely greater.
2. The time complexity of a function increases the greater the number of inputs in a data set. Considering this data set contains 10000 values, it will take a longer time to run than a data set that contains 1000 values. 
3. Using a balanced search tree guarantees logarithmic time complexity which makes the time to perform the searches and insertions predictable. The tree rotates to remain balanced which helps with keeping the tree from increasing too much vertically as values are added and aids in retrieving inputs.
